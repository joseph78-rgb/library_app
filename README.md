In this app there are basically four webpages. That is, the homepage, the lending page, the lendingstatus page and the modifying page. The homepage homepage is where all books
are displayed and librarians can search for a specific book here and be able to see if a book is readily available for lending or if the book has already been taken. A new book
can be added as well here.
If the user click on a borrow link on homepage they will be redirected to the borrowing page where they will have to fill a borrower info i.e ID, first name and last name if user
is new to the system or just an their ID if they are had previously registered and they are now just borrowing for the second time. if successull the system will update the database 
and the charging of the book should start then.
On the homepage a user can as well click on titleof a specific book and be redirected to the modifying page where they can change information of an existing book that is,
they can upadate a book serial number, title, author or category. The book can as well be deleted from th system here.
